-  Brett Cannon</p>

                    <p>As the Pycon was top item in my Bucket list finally the wait was over as pycon Pune chapter was on, as the venue for the conference changed it was now "Amanora The Fern Hotels and Resorts" . It was 1 hour drive from my place , I woke up at 7 and zhoooom I reached before time .
I got my badge and acquired the middle row seat, the conference started with Honza Král as the keynote speaker for pycon. As I was surrounded by developers I thought this might not be my piece of cake as I am new to python and so far I am still learning stuff, but Honza's keynote talk inspired me a lot and the fear of being a beginner was gone , he explained the elastic search thing and it did hit my mind as it was completely new technology I got to know about.  </p>

                    <p>In the tea break I met Honza, I had a conversation with him and I asked him lots of queries, he guided me in the best possible way, and I became fan of the Django developer.</p>

                    <p>Other talks were also good, the one for Documentation was very impressive , GNU Mailman 3 talk by Florian Fuchs was a great, I had a chat with him in lunch break he is superb mentor and a great pythonista.

John hawley "pearl guy" was the star of pycon  , he deals with micro python and he has a great sense of humour :D.</p>

                    <p>I met python Pune community members and I am there fan , as each one of them is very down to earth and very helpful. I met rahul Bhaiya , suraj Bhaiya , chandan Bhaiya , kushal da and other community members . The pycon was moreover organised by python Pune group. I did met python Hyderabad members and they were great. 

I got different logo stickers from Redhat, Elastic-search, reserved-bit , python etc, the pycon t-shirt is one of the coolest Tee in my collection ;).</p>
                     <p>Each volunteer in Pycon Pune worked day and night to make this conference a grand success, I saw their co-ordination and everyone was .

The developer's whom I met were very friendly and talented, I met a very good human being pradeep shetty he is very inspiring personality. </p>
                     <p>I feel lucky to be a part of such a big community whose members are more like family. I guess I was the first guy to book the ticket for conference ;), as the booking started in the month of November and I booked my seat the very first day;). Waiting for Pycon India  2017 Delhi chapter as I did stayed for the community and I am damn happy.

Happy coding ☺</p>
